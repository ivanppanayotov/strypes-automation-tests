/**
 * @description     This class shows the solution for right-clicking mouse action over an element.
 *                  The class contains examples of Playwright commands and domain-specific language (custom methods).
 *                  As you can see in the Playwright example/s, we use both domain-specific language methods and Playwright functions. The example related to this class is shown in Playwright functions, and the other part of the code is shown (most probably) in domain-specific language methods.
