Our framework is not perfect. In this file, we will collect everything that we will add in the future.
1. Add more examples in browserWindow.spec.ts file. We need to cover "New Window" and "New Window Message" from "https://demoqa.com/browser-windows".
2. Add a custom command in the domain-specific language to handle the alert pop-up window that appears after some time. We can use this from the documentation: https://playwright.dev/docs/dialogs
3. We need to find a way to verify broken images or links. We can use this from the official documentation because we should use vanilla JS for this : https://playwright.dev/docs/evaluating.
